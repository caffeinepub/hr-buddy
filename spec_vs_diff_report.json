  "summary": "All three requirements (REQ-13, REQ-14, REQ-15) are substantially implemented. The diff shows a new DemoBookingSection component with all required fields and validation, backend main.mo with DemoRequest type and both methods, and the useSubmitDemoRequest hook in useQueries.ts. Minor observations: REQ-14 requires validation that name is non-empty in addition to email, but the backend only validates email format. All other acceptance criteria appear met.",

      "reason": "The backend main.mo only calls validateEmail (checks for '@' and '.'), but does not explicitly validate that the name field is non-empty. The AC states both email and name must be validated.",
